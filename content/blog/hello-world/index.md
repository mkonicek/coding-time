I finally got around to moving my blog from Medium to Gatsby.

The name "Coding time" goes back to my very first blog from a decade ago. It is inspired by the flow when you focus and everything else disappears.

Setting up [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and migrating content from Medium was ridiculously easy thanks to a [great article](https://www.no.lol/2019-03-16-medium-to-gatsby/) by [Lauren Tan](https://twitter.com/sugarpirate_). Already going with the hype by using Gatsby, I even threw in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) which builds and publishes the blog after every commit. Soon I had the blog up and running at https://coding-time.vercel.app.

Then I just bought the domain and in the domain management interface, pointed the DNS record for `coding-time.co` at the IP address shown in the Vercel admin interface.

All of the above took about two hours. Then I manually fixed the formatting in some of the generated markdown and copied images over, often looking for better, higher-quality versions of the images in my Dropbox or online. This was straightforward and took a few hours.

It feels great to have a new blog, with no paywall, no signups, no ads. Writing in markdown and publishing with `git push` is amazing.

I even brought back some of the top posts from my original blog - the one before Medium, such as:

- [Covariance and Contravariance](../covariance-contravariance)
- [Transactions and Event Sourcing](../transactions-event-sourcing)

Happy new year! ðŸŽ‰
