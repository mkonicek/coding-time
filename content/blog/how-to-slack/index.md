I‚Äôve recently joined a startup where we use Slack as our main communication tool.

At first Slack seemed extremely chaotic but over time I learned how to use it efficiently‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow to get value out of it and be responsive without wasting too much time. All I had to do was fix my settings and promote a culture of using threads.

### **td;dr**

- **Use threads**
- Short messages
- Fix your sidebar
- Star / leave channels
- Semantic emojis
- All Threads screen

### Three questions

When I first started using Slack, I immediately had three pressing questions:

- **How do I see what‚Äôs important?**
- **How do I make sure to follow up?**
- **Where do I post?**

We look at these questions below:

### 1\. **How do I see what‚Äôs important?**

By default, Slack is just a long wall of text. I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs relevant to me without reading all of it. Channels should help with this, so we created some. But now there are too many channels:

#### Fix Your¬†Sidebar

To solve this issue of information overload, we‚Äôll need to do a few things. First, fix your sidebar. Go to Settings ‚Üí Sidebar:

Next, star a few channels you really want to keep track of:

Suddenly, your sidebar is much cleaner:

You should also **leave channels** you‚Äôre not reading anyway:

Now press **Shift+Esc** to mark everything as read and start with a clean slate. You can still jump to any channel later by pressing **Cmd+K**.

#### Use Threads for Everything

Just fixing your Slack settings is not enough. People need to communicate in a way that‚Äôs easy to parse.

Consider using **semantic emojis**. Thanks to [Emma Guy](https://twitter.com/emmaguy) for the idea. Example:

üî• Something is wrong and needs attention now
‚ÑπÔ∏è General message informing the channel
‚ùìQuestion
¬†üîà Announcement
üí°Idea

You should **start a thread for every new topic**! I can‚Äôt stress how important this is. It **completely changes your Slack experience** from a chaotic screen of text into a neat list of topics.

Keep the message short. If you want to add more info, add it in the first comment! With threads like this, it‚Äôs much easier to quickly scan the contents of a channel and have a good idea what‚Äôs going on.

#### Bonus

Occasionally check out the **Highlights** view:

### 2\. **How do I make sure to follow¬†up?**

I had the following problem. Say I‚Äôm talking to someone in a thread:

> Jami: Are we ready to ship?
> me: Yes, should I go ahead?
> <I close Slack, Jami replied a bit later>

However, I **never knew he replied**:

#### Use the All Threads¬†Screen

You might suggest turning on all notifications but that will notify you for all messages in all channels. Let‚Äôs use a different solution‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe awesome **All Threads** screen. It has all the discussions you‚Äôre part of, newest at the top:

You can also create your own quick To-do list. Just star a message that‚Äôs important to you:

You can see all your starred messages in the top right corner of Slack:

#### Help People by Mentioning Them

You can also help people see important messages by @mentioning them. Make sure you get notified when others mention you:

#### Bonus

You can Show Activity in the top right corner to see when people react to your posts:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*o-3NB61FqNP97Cf-.png)

You can go back/forward between your conversations. This only works with channels, not threads, however:

### 3\. Where do I¬†post?

The last question is: ‚ÄúI want to post something, but in which channel?‚Äù ü§î

Try **Cmd+K** and guess some channel names:

Every channel should have a topic so you know what it‚Äôs about:

#### Use Channels, not Private¬†Messages

A big benefit of using Slack is that everyone at the company has visibility into discussions. Use channels as much as possible and avoid private messages as much as possible.

### Conclusion

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve learned so far. It‚Äôs just a few easy tips but they made all the difference for us, especially the usage of **threads**.

Hope these tips will help you stay focused, find important posts and enjoy Slack üëç

_If you only remember one thing from this post, remember the usage of threads:_

### Appendix: Should you use Slack at¬†all?

There are around 200 people at my company. As explained in this post, it was possible to make Slack work for us.

But what about using Workplace instead? I wrote a [short separate post about Workplace](https://medium.com/p/afd7eaa2a233).
